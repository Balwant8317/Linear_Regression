Title:Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

This is a simple machine learning project that uses linear regression to predict an individual's salary based on their years of experience. Linear regression is a fundamental and widely used technique in the field of machine learning and statistics.


Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, salary) and one or more independent variables (in this case, years of experience). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and tries to find the best-fitting line to make predictions.

In this project, we have implemented a simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical data of salaries and years of experience.
